# lambda-layer-mssql-pyodbc
A python 3.8 layer which can be included in the AWS lambda function to connect to MSSQL databases. It contains the pyodbc library which will be used as a dialect by SqlAlchemy and the sql server client files zipped together. This is compatible with python running version >= 3.8 and using sqlalchemy to connect to the sql server database. Feel free to use the layer directly.
